# Pong

This is my recreation of the game Pong in Python using Pygame modules.

HOW TO PLAY: There are two boards on the left and right side of the screen, with the left one being under your control, and the right one being the AIs. A ball will bounce in between the two, and you must use the arrow keys to move your board and make sure the ball does not bounce past your board, or else you lose a point. See if you can gain more points than the bot!

To run the game, download the main python file named "Pong.py". Also download the .wav file, in addition to the Python and Pygame applications.
